    flavor: "Flavor represents the coffee's principal character, "+
    "the \"mid-range\" notes, in between the first impressions given by the "+
    "coffee's first aroma and acidity to its final aftertaste. It is a "+
    "combined impression of all gustatory (taste bud) sensations "+
    "and retro-nasal aromas that go from the mouth to nose. The score "+
    "given for Flavor should account for the intensity, quality and "+
    "complexity of its combined taste and aroma, experienced when "+
    "the coffee is slurped into the mouth vigorously so as to involve the "+
    "entire palate in the evaluation.",
    acidity: "Acidity is often described as \"brightness\" when favorable "+
    "or \"sour\" when unfavorable. At its best, acidity contributes to a "+
    "coffee's liveliness, sweetness, and fresh- fruit character and is "+
    "almost immediately experienced and evaluated when the coffee is "+
    "first slurped into the mouth. Acidity that is overly intense or "+
    "dominating may be unpleasant, however, and excessive acidity "+
    "may not be appropriate to the flavor profile of the sample. The "+
    "final score marked on the horizontal scale should reflect "+
    "the panelist’s perceived quality for the Acidity relative to the "+
    "expected flavor profile based on origin characteristics and/or "+
    "other factors (degree of roast, intended use, etc.). Coffees "+
    "expected to be high in Acidity, such as a Kenya coffee, or coffees "+
    "expected to be low in Acidity, such as a Sumatra coffee, can "+
    "receive equally high preference scores although their intensity "+
    "will be quite different.",
    aroma: "The aromatic aspects include Fragrance "+
    "(defined as the smell of the ground coffee when still dry) and "+
    "Aroma (the smell of the coffee when infused with hot water). One "+
    "can evaluate this at three distinct steps in the cupping process: (1) "+
    "sniffing the grounds placed into the cup before pouring water "+
    "onto the coffee; (2) sniffing the aromas released while breaking "+
    "the crust; and (3) sniffing the aromas released as the coffee "+
    "steeps. The score finally given should reflect the preference "+
    "of all three aspects of a sample’s Fragrance/Aroma.",
    body: "The quality of Body is based upon the tactile feeling of the "+
    "liquid in the mouth, especially as perceived between the tongue "+
    "and roof of the mouth. Most samples with heavy Body may also "+
    "receive a high score in terms of quality due to the presence of "+
    "brew colloids and sucrose. Some samples with lighter Body may "+
    "also have a pleasant feeling in the mouth, however. Coffees "+
    "expected to be high in Body, such as a Sumatra coffee, or coffees "+
    "expected to be low in Body, such as a Mexican coffee, can receive "+
    "equally high preference scores although their intensity will be "+
    "quite different.",
    sweetness: "Sweetness refers to a pleasing fullness of flavor as "+
    "well as any obvious sweetness and its perception is the result of "+
    "the presence of certain carbohydrates. The opposite of sweetness "+
    "in this context is sour, astringency or “green” flavors. This quality "+
    "may not be directly perceived as in sucrose-laden products such "+
    "as soft drinks, but will affect other flavor attributes.",
    aftertaste: "Aftertaste is defined as the length of positive flavor "+
    "(taste and aroma) qualities emanating from the back of the palate "+
    "and remaining after the coffee is expectorated or swallowed. If the "+
    "aftertaste were short or unpleasant, a lower score would be given.",
    overall: "The “overall” scoring aspect is meant to reflect the "+
    "holistically integrated rating of the sample as perceived by the "+
    "individual panelist. A sample with many highly pleasant aspects, "+
    "but not quite “measuring up” would receive a lower rating. A "+
    "coffee that met expectations as to its character and reflected "+
    "particular origin flavor qualities would receive a high score. An "+
    "exemplary example of preferred characteristics not fully reflected "+
    "in the individual score of the individual attributes might receive an "+
    "even higher score. This is the step where the panelists make their "+
    "personal appraisal."
