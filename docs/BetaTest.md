## Intro message:
Hi!

Thanks so much for agreeing to help beta test Craft Coffee! Here's a link to fill out a form you can share your at home brewing process and a good contact email. The link to download Craft Coffee from TestFlight, Apple's official beta testing platform, will be sent to this address.

Once you download the app testing can begin immediately. I'm hoping everyone will have the app installed by this coming Friday, November 5th. This round of testing will be official over November 30th, after which you can optionally continue testing the app, or if an official release is ready, download Craft Coffee from the App Store.

An important part of this initial testing period is ensuring all of the interactions in the app are intuitive. If you can't figure something out, find something you don't like, or come up with a feature you'd like to see added, submit feedback through TestFlight. (Instructions provided in the form below)
